Enum with values automatically mapped to strings.

[Boost.Preprocessor](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/preprocessor/)
is used to automatically generate a class wrapper around enum
with static member functions to convert between enum and string values
as well as overloaded << and >> stream operators.
